I find T-Shirts to be fascinating. Give someone a free t-shirt, and unless the content is unnecessairly absurd they will probably wear it.

Why? My guess is that it's because T-Shirts usually cost a fairly substancial amount of money in stores, but branded T-Shirts such as ones with company logos across the front are usually free.

I've caught myself wearing a T-Shirt before with the logo of a company I don't even care about printed across the front in large bold letters. As far as I know, I've seen other people do it too.

What fascinates me is that T-Shirts seem to be the only product that we will do this too. Imagine a company giving you a bumber sticker. Unless you truly loved or worked for the company, would you put it on your car? What if they gave you a free T-Shirt, what are the chances that you would wear it at least once?
