Success in the startup world is too narrowly defined.

When you ask your neighbor to list three successful startups, they will probably list something along the lines of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Sure these companies have [users out the wazoo][1], do you have to as well? No. Yeah, you can be successful by gaining millions of users, but success is much more than that.

Success in the world of startups is making a profitable company. It’s solving the problem that your customer has, even if that customer isn’t everyone and their brother.

You don’t have to focus on solving the problems of 100% of the world’s population. Instead, solve the problem that 2% of the world has, and do it well.

Look at [37Signals][2], a startup often regarded as successful. They aren’t used by everyone you know. Instead, they found a niche and served that niche well.

Not all startups are as sexy as you see on [TechCrunch][3]. Don’t do a startup with your only goal being to become rich and famous. Instead, make a kickass product that’s profitable and solves the problem that your customer has.
