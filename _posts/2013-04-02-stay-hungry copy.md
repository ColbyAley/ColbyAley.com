##"Stay hungry, stay foolish" -Steve Jobs

I see this quote everywhere and you probably do too. Twitter, blogs, personal websites. Everywhere. Most people in the tech community have heard this Jobs quote, but what makes the Jobs quote so beautiful and so popular? Why do people like it? What does it really mean?

###"Stay hungryâ€¦"

Don't be pleased with your current state of being. Don't settle for anything. Dream big, and do whatever it takes to make those dreams come true. After your dreams do come true, do not stop there. Dream even bigger. Set the bar higher. 

###"stay foolish."

Be willing to take risks. Disregard the status quo. Ignore best practices. Fail, and learn from your failures. 

Most notable things were created by people who had no idea what they were doing, but were crazy enough to take a chance at doing it. Examples: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Woz. Did they have MBAs and graduate from Ivy League schools? No. None of them had even ran a successful company before. They were foolish enough to not let that stop them, and they went on to change the world, in their own different and innovative ways.

Question the way people currently do things and be willing to do things differently.
