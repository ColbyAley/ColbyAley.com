I discovered [Simplenote][1] quite some time ago through a podcast I listen to, but have just recently decided to try it out. If you are unaware of what Simplenote is, it’s a freemium service that allows you to sync notes, essentially .txt files, easily across your Mac, PC, and iOS device using 1st and [3rd party apps][2]. Since signing up I’ve been paying for the $2/month [premium plan][3] that comes with a couple extra features as well as premium support.

I use Simplenote pretty much as a braindump. The files in my Simplenote are somewhat unorganized. The main file is a my todo list, where I simply jot down all the things I have to do that I probably would not remember without the list. My Simplenote is also full of business ideas, books to read, fonts I like, blog posts (like this one) and websites that I think are well designed.

I use a couple different Simplenote apps. Justnotes on the Mac and Listary as well as the official app on the iPhone.

**Justnotes [[Link][4]]**  
Justnotes is one of the most simple and beautiful Mac apps that I’ve used. It integrates seamlessly with Simplenote and can also back up to your Mac’s local drive. I keep it open whenever I’m on my mac and use it to keep track of everything; code, todo lists, books to read, movies to watch.

**Listary [[Link][5]]**  
Listary is a great iOS app for keeping lists and syncing them with Simplenote. I use it when I’m on the go and need to add something to my todo list, or hear of a book that I’d like to read.

Simplenote is one of those services that just works. You don’t have to think about it, you just use it. I recommend that you try it… the free version is great and the paid version is always there if you find that you crave more.
