Recently, Twitter has released multiple blog posts [pretty much][1] [stating][2] that they are no longer interested in people developing applications for their platform.

Twitter has decided to turn its back against 3rd party app developers because of monetization. After taking millions in VC funding, Twitter finally has to start showing some real numbers to those investors. So they’ve decided to do away with the ecosystem of 3rd party clients. Many people have been asking, “why doesn’t Twitter just require developers to put Twitter’s ads in their software?”

This would not work for a couple of reasons:

1.  Twitter’s revenue can’t rely on 3rd parties. As an example, what happens if [Tweetbot][3] brings in 5% of Twitter’s annual revenue, then the guys at Tapbots decide to close doors? Twitter’s investors would not be happy. No venture-backed company in their right mind would rely on 3rd parties for revenue.
2.  Working with developers to incorporate ads would be extremely cumbersome. Twitter’s ecosystem includes 1 million apps [as of][4] last year. How do you expect Twitter to reach out to all of them? Easy. You only reach out to the top few. Sure, that will work until users flock (see what I did there?) to less popular apps.

These new updates make it clear that Twitter has focused on making their investors happy rather than their developers, and inevitably their millions of users. Do they have a reason to? Sure. Is it the best option for the users? Probably not.
