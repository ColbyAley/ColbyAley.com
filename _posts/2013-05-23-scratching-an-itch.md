title: "Why Most Developers Should Not Be 'Scratching An Itch'"
published: true

If you're a developer living in say, San Francisco, making six figures, reading this on a MacBook while sipping tea and pondering startup ideas, I have news for you. You need to throw the popular idea of 'scratching your own itch' out window. It does not and should not apply to you.

Now, I'm not saying that the idea of scratching an itch is a flawed one. On the contrary, I believe that you *should* make something that scratches an itch of yours, that solves a problem you personally have. That's the only way to truly make something great. If you are going to scratch an itch though, please don't scratch the same itch as every other developer. Differentiate yourself. Walk in the shoes of someone who has **actual** problems that need solving. Consider spending time with people who don't have as much access to technology, what problems do they have? How can you help solve those problems?

Developer tools are fun, but there are tons of them. It's a completely over saturated market. Instead of wasting your time on say, another developer tool, open your eyes and make something that changes the world.

This is something I've recently been thinking about, and it's something other developers, designers, and entrepreneurs should focus on as well.
