title: The Best iPhone Case Is No Case At All

Ever since I purchased my first iPhone, a 16GB iPhone 3G, I’ve used a case. I’ve tried out some great cases, like the Speck CandyShell, Speck PixelSkin HD, and the Twelve South BookBook. I’ve also used some not so great cases such as the Apple iPhone Bumper.

About a week ago I took my iPhone out of the case to dust off the back of it as well as clean the screen. I then realized what a beautiful device the iPhone is and how light it is without a case. Why would I want to cover up such a beautiful device? I decided that for the rest of the day I would not use a case. As the day went on I questioned why I ever put a case on the beautiful iPhone to begin with.

Without the case I was a little afraid that the phone would break if I dropped it, but to this date that has not happened. I have found that I rarely drop my iPhone, so this really isn’t a problem.

If you keep a case on your phone, why? I haven’t looked back since taking the case off of my iPhone. The phone is lighter, feels better in the hand, and looks better. If you currently have a case on your phone, I challenge you to take the case off for a day.
