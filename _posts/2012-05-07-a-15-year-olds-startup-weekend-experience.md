When I walked in to Startup Weekend a week ago I had absolutely no experience at all. I did not know how to code a website, to develop an app, to create a logo, or how to start a business. I was nothing more than an inexperienced 15 year old with a desire to create something cool and learn a bit while doing so.

I had spent the previous three days creating and practicing my one minute elevator pitch. I was ninth in line, and close to 70 people would be pitching after me. Before I knew it I was speaking in front of 150 strangers, including some of Portland’s most successful entrepreneurs, designers, and developers.

After giving my pitch and listening to the pitches of everyone else, it was finally time to vote on the ideas. Some of the ideas got no votes, while some of the ideas received up to 26 votes. After being tallied up by the organizers, it was announced that my idea had received 11 votes, enough to make it to the top 15 ideas. These top 15 ideas would then attract teams of Startup Weekend attendees and be developed over the course of the weekend. I formed a team with [Ken Westin][1], who I had known before the weekend, and [Joey Petelle][2], an extremely smart person. We would spend the next 50 hours working on [uEdit.me][3], a service that connects writers and bloggers with editors.

I learned more over the course of that weekend than any textbook or schoolteacher could teach me in a year. I learned what goes in to creating a business, how to work well in a small group of people, and how to determine what needs to get done in order to meet the deadline. I walked in to [Portland Startup Weekend][4] with no experience whatsoever, and still found a way to get as much out of it as I had expected. What [they say][5] is true, Startup Weekend is a no talk, all action environment. You are not judged based on your experience, but on how well you can get the job done.

Startup Weekend was an extraordinary experience, and was an invaluable use of my time and money. I learned a lot and met some of Portland’s greatest entrepreneurs. My team and I have decided to move on with our project, uEdit.me, and are making great strides towards a version accessible to the public.

I would encourage anyone to [attend a Startup Weekend][6]. Whether you work for a Fortune 500 company, are unemployed, or anywhere in-between, there’s certainty something you could learn from attending a Startup Weekend event. At Startup Weekend qualifications do not matter, it’s what you do during the weekend that counts.
