Here’s what [Jackson Gariety][1] and I have been working on for the last few weeks.

The List is a social knowledge aggregator, a link sharing site with a focus on high quality content. We’ve identified many of the key problems with other link sharing sites such as [Hacker News][2] and Reddit, and addressed those with The List.

For example, one key aspect of The List is that you have to be invited to post, and posting will cost you credits. This forces people to question the quality of the content before they post, which in turn will promote higher quality links.

We created The List because we wanted a place to go and find high quality articles related to tech and business. Hopefully you’ll find it helpful as well.
