##Hi, I'm Colby.

**I'm a 16 year old student from Portland, Oregon with an interest in business, startups, and technology.**

I enjoy using computers and the internet to make things that not only people enjoy using, but that solve problems.

###Projects

I started a thing called a [Hackalone](http://hackalone.org) with a couple of friends, with a goal of making it easy and fun to tinker with new concepts and technologies.

I help organize [CodeDay Portland](http://portland.codeday.org), a 24 hour hackathon for high school and college students.

Last summer I interned at [Launchside](http://launchside.com), a local development studio here in Portland.

I created [The List](http://thelist.io) with my friend [Jackson Gariety](http://jacksongariety.com), with a goal of making it easier for developers, entreprenuers, and designers to find high quality content online.
