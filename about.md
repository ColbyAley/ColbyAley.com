##Hi, I'm Colby.

**I'm a 16 year old student from Portland, Oregon with an interest in business, startups, and technology.**

I enjoy using computers and the internet to make things that not only people enjoy using, but that solve problems.

###Projects

I started a thing called a [Hackalone](http://hackalone.org) with a couple of friends, with a goal of making it easy and fun to tinker with new concepts and technologies.

I helped organize [CodeDay Portland](http://portland.codeday.org), a 24 hour hackathon for high school and college students.

I created [The List](http://thelist.io) with my friend [Jackson Gariety](http://jacksongariety.com), with a goal of making it easier for developers, entreprenuers, and designers to find high quality content online.

I'm also a Business Analyst intern at [Launchside](http://launchside.com), a local development studio here in Portland.

###About this blog

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on a [Linode](http://linode.com). I have not published the code behind this website just yet, but plan to in the future. In the meantime, feel free to contact me if you need help setting up your own Jekyll blog.

I have used [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) for years, but recently switched to Jekyll because of speed and simplicity.

I am using [Gauges](http://get.gaug.es) to monitor the traffic on this blog. I use [GoSquared](http://gosquared.com) on many of my projects.

###Contact me

I love to talk to people about code, computers, and startups. Feel free to shoot me an email at [colby@aley.me](mailto://colby@aley.me).

Keep rockin'.
