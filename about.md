## Hi, I'm Colby.

**I'm a 17 year old student from Portland, Oregon with an interest in business, startups, and technology.**

I enjoy using computers and the internet to make things that not only people enjoy using, but that solve problems.

### Experience

I am currently a software engineering intern at [Cloudability](http://cloudability.com). We help companies manage their cloud costs.

Last summer I interned at [Launchside](http://launchside.com), a local development studio here in Portland.

### Projects

I started a thing called a [Hackalone](http://hackalone.org) with a couple of friends, with a goal of making it easy and fun to tinker with new concepts and technologies.

I created [The List](http://thelist.io) with my friend [Jackson Gariety](http://jacksongariety.com), with a goal of making it easier for developers, entreprenuers, and designers to find high quality content online.

Chances are I'm currently working on a side project. If you're interested, I suggest checking out [my Github Profile](http://github.com/ColbyAley). There's usually something going on over there.

### Other cool things

I help organize [CodeDay Portland](http://portland.codeday.org), a 24 hour hackathon for high school and college students.

### About this blog

I use this blog to share my thoughts with the world, including you.

I am using [Gauges](http://get.gaug.es) to monitor the traffic on this blog. I also use [GoSquared](http://gosquared.com) on many of my projects.

I love to talk to people about code, computers, and startups. Feel free to shoot me an email at [colby@aley.me](mailto://colby@aley.me) or say hi on Twitter. I'm [@aley](http://twitter.com/aley).
