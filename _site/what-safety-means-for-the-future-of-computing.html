  <h1> What Safety Means for the Future of Computing </h1>
  
  <p class="date">Posted 10 January 2013</p>
<p>Since the inception of the personal computer, using one has been seen as something unhealthy. Something that causes eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and back pains. This has done more than cause trips to the hospital, but has given computers the negative connotations of being unnatural, unsafe, and unhealthy.</p>

<p>Computers are becoming more and more present in our every day lives, but at the same time they haven't become any safer to use. More and more jobs involve using computers on a daily basis, yet using one is often seen as unhealthy. In fact, from what I have observed people will naturally limit their computer use because they believe that using one is unnatural and wrong. With something proven to help us in so many ways, why should this still be happening?</p>

<p>How can we make computers safer to use, and in turn shift in how people use them, and how they are perceived?</p>

<p>With the rising number of computers in the home, the workplace, and now in the pocket, this is extremely important. It is something worth thinking about — “What can be done to make computers safer and more natural to use?” I'm not talking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trek-TD-01-TrekDesk-Treadmill-Desk/dp/B002IYRBI0">treadmill desks</a>. No, I'm talking about designing computers to have less negative health effects, which will in turn fundamentally alter how people think of, and use them.</p>

<p>There's a huge opportunity for the first person to figure this out, and an even larger one for the first person to do it right.</p>
