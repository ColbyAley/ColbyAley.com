<p>I quite <a href="https://twitter.com/aley/status/358438664302379011">enjoy</a> setting up new development environments, installing the languages and databases I use, configuring my editors, and downloading my apps. Though I keep relatively frequent backups of my computer, I tend to never use them. Instead, when setting up a new computer I go through my mental checklist of the tools I need and how they should be configured. I evaluate the tools as I go, question their usefulness, and spend a few minutes to configure each of them properly.</p>

<p>I highly suggest other developers give this a try as well. With so many developer tools being released, it's easy to end up with a clusterf**k of tools on your machine. This is a problem, because as developers it's important we keep tabs on what we have in our toolbelt. It's important we're aware of the software we use and how it's configured. That we don't let anything slip past our eyes. Because after all, we're using this software to write better software ourselves. If you don't know how the tools you use work, it's going to shine through in the code you write.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A responsible programmer knows her tools. She will always try to learn more about them and she will replace them if other tools are invented that work better. But she doesn't change her tools for the latest fashion." - Anders Janmyr, <a href="http://anders.janmyr.com/2013/04/a-responsible-programmer.html">A Responsible Programmer</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So I challenge you, next time you are in a position to set up a new development machine, don't just restore from a backup. Instead, set aside a few hours and take the time to install your tools by hand, evaluating and configuring them as you go.</p>
