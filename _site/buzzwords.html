  <h1> The Five Most Annoying Buzzwords </h1>
  
  <p class="date">Posted 03 July 2012</p>
<p>Buzzwords are everywhere. Words that have little meaning and value, used only to make a product sound more enticing and cutting edge. In reality, using buzzwords just makes you sound like an idiot. Sometimes these words can have legitimate meanings, but it’s the large amount of people applying random meanings to them that gives the word buzzword status.</p>

<p>Though there are (way too) many buzzwords flying around to list them all, here’s five that annoy me the most.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>1. The ‘Cloud’</strong><br/>
Let’s just admit it, nobody knows what “the cloud” really is. In reality, the word is nothing more than a cute name for servers that belong to other people. The cloud doesn’t consist of fairies and unicorns, but rather ugly old servers with huge hard drives.</p>

<p><strong>2. The ‘App’</strong><br/>
Ever since the Apple App Store launched, apps have been hotter than ever. Consumers love their apps, so companies assume that they want apps everywhere. On their TV, in their car, on their wrist, even on the refrigerator. Though apps are real things, it’s the marketing departments that overuse the word, giving it buzzword status.</p>

<p><strong>3. ‘Innovative’</strong><br/>
So your idea is innovative? Whoa! Finally, someone who has an innovative idea! Jokes aside, I hate this word. Don’t tell people that your idea is innovative, prove it to them. Let them be the judge.</p>

<p><strong>4. ‘Disrupt’</strong><br/>
People use this word far too often in startup pitches. It drives me nuts. It makes you sound like an idiot and your idea sound goofy. That’s not what you want.</p>

<p><strong>5. ‘x for y’ analogies</strong><br/>
It’s Instagram for video! Twitter for cats. Foursquare for pilots. Facebook for toddlers… Argh! These drive me bonkers. Riding the wave of other people’s success is dangerous, and that’s exactly what this is. Don’t do it, kids.</p></blockquote>
