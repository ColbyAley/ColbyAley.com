          <p class="date">Posted 02 April 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <h2>"Stay hungry, stay foolish" -Steve Jobs</h2>

<p>I see this quote everywhere and you probably do too. Twitter, blogs, personal websites. Everywhere. Most people in the tech community have heard this Jobs quote, but what makes the Jobs quote so beautiful and so popular? Why do people like it? What does it really mean?</p>

<h3>"Stay hungry…"</h3>

<p>Don't be pleased with your current state of being. Don't settle for anything. Dream big, and do whatever it takes to make those dreams come true. After your dreams do come true, do not stop there. Dream even bigger. Set the bar higher.</p>

<h3>"stay foolish."</h3>

<p>Be willing to take risks. Disregard the status quo. Ignore best practices. Fail, and learn from your failures.</p>

<p>Most notable things were created by people who had no idea what they were doing, but were crazy enough to take a chance at doing it. Examples: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Woz. Did they have MBAs and graduate from Ivy League schools? No. None of them had even ran a successful company before. They were foolish enough to not let that stop them, and they went on to change the world, in their own different and innovative ways.</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, but in the experts mind there are few." - Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki</p></blockquote>

<p>Question the way people currently do things and be willing to do things differently.</p>

          <h1><a href="/watching-from-the-sidelines.html" class="posttitle" rel="bookmark">Watching From The Sidelines</a></h1>
          <p class="date">Posted 19 March 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>It's not rare that I stumble upon a blog post where the founder of a startup talks about their launch, how many users they signed up, and how much they learned from it. Well, I think that you can learn a lot from other people's startups too, without having to take part in them. I think the ability to learn from startups that aren't yours is very useful. Here's how I learn from products and the people behind them, all while just watching from the sidelines.</p>

<p>Whenever a new social networking service emerges I usually sign up and try it out, usually to see what the hype is about and to give it a fair chance. I do this because trying out other  apps and services is a great way to learn how to create your own. It's a great chance to learn how they launched and created hype, why people are using it, how effective their signup process is, and most importantly, what aspects of the service you should or should not use in your next project.</p>

<p>There's a lot you can learn from launches, but if you actually spend some time and use the service, you end up learning a lot more. For as much as the launch exposes about the service and the people behind it, they only undercover a fraction of the methodology behind it.</p>

<p>It's important to ask questions such as why are people using it? What real problems does it solve? If there's other services already doing something like this, what makes it special?</p>

<hr />

<p>Let's use <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> as an example. Foursquare launched four years ago, but students at my high school are just now beginning to use it. Why now? Why are they using it over Facebook's Places feature, where most students already have accounts? Thanks to the notifications I receive whenever a Facebook friend of mine signs up for Foursquare, I have been able to see exactly how the service is spreading throughout my school. First it was one group of friends, then it spread to another. After becoming Foursquare friends with a few of these people, I was interested to see that many of their checkins have photos attached. From what I've seen, they take many more photos than my original Foursquare friends. Why? Facebook already allows you to attach photos to Places checkins. What makes Foursquare more appealing?</p>

<p>How is Foursquare targeting these people? From what I can tell, they're using Facebook and Twitter, services the students are already on. Once they can get a few key people to join, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a> will start doing it's thing, and more and more students will begin to sign up because their friends wanted them to.</p>

<p>Foursquare aimed at early adopters first, then relied on existing social networks and word of mouth to spread to the average consumer.</p>

<hr />

<p>Foursquare is just one example. I challenge you to sit down and consider how other startups launched, and moved from the early adopter stage to the average consumer stage. What techniques did they use? How did they target the early adopters? Most importantly, how can you apply these techniques to your own startup?</p>

<p>Digging below the surface and analyzing products and their launches can be very helpful. There's a lot that you can learn without having to really do anything yourself. What kind of questions will you ponder?</p>

          <h1><a href="/t-shirts.html" class="posttitle" rel="bookmark">T-Shirts</a></h1>
          <p class="date">Posted 12 March 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>I find T-Shirts to be fascinating. Give someone a free t-shirt, and unless the content is unnecessairly absurd they will probably wear it.</p>

<p>Why? My guess is that it's because T-Shirts usually cost a fairly substancial amount of money in stores, but branded T-Shirts such as ones with company logos across the front are usually free.</p>

<p>I've caught myself wearing a T-Shirt before with the logo of a company I don't even care about printed across the front in large bold letters. As far as I know, I've seen other people do it too.</p>

<p>What fascinates me is that T-Shirts seem to be the only product that we will do this too. Imagine a company giving you a bumber sticker. Unless you truly loved or worked for the company, would you put it on your car? What if they gave you a free T-Shirt, what are the chances that you would wear it at least once?</p>

          <p class="date">Posted 29 January 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>Here’s what <a href="http://jacksongariety.com">Jackson Gariety</a> and I have been working on for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The List is a social knowledge aggregator, a link sharing site with a focus on high quality content. We’ve identified many of the key problems with other link sharing sites such as <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and Reddit, and addressed those with The List.</p>

<p>For example, one key aspect of The List is that you have to be invited to post, and posting will cost you credits. This forces people to question the quality of the content before they post, which in turn will promote higher quality links.</p>

<p>We created The List because we wanted a place to go and find high quality articles related to tech and business. Hopefully you’ll find it helpful as well.</p>

            <blockquote><p>The most common thing I hear from aspiring entrepreneurs is, “I have this idea for an app or site. But I’m not technical, so I need to find someone who can make it for me.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A great blog post that explains why it is important for everyone, especially entrepreneurs, to learn basic programming. He brings up a great point: If you need to make a site, or make a prototype for your new idea, why rely on someone else? Why not learn how to do it yourself?</p>
