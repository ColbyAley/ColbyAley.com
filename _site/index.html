          <p class="date">Posted 29 April 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>"Hey kid, shut the fuck up. You don't know me and you don't know what the hell you're talking about."</p>

<p>If that's what is going through your head right now, I invite you to spend three minutes of your life reading this. I guarantee that reading this will not get in the way of your startup raising it's next funding round. It will not stop you from accomplishing your goals. And most importantly, I guarantee you that these three minutes are not what will make or break your success in life.</p>

<hr />

<p>People love the idea of being busy. Why? Because it makes them feel important. It makes them feel like someone is relying on them. It makes them feel like they're part of something larger than themselves.</p>

<p>Though at the time they may not enjoy it, people naturally like inboxes full of other people depending on them. They like the thought of being busy, shooting emails off like mad, staying up all night coding. Just trying to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>This occurs in different levels in almost every industry. People who think they are too busy to respond to your call. People who are too important to take a walk and talk with you.</p>

<p>This also happens because people love calculating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment">ROI</a> of everything. People are naturally selfish creatures and love to ask, "what's in it for me?" when presented with a situation.</p>

<p>Humans have a problem accepting the fact that sometimes you can't calculate ROI on everything. Some things will not make you any smarter, they will not make you any more successful in your business or personal life, they will not turn you into a millionaire, but that's okay.</p>

<p>Relax a little. Watch that TV show you've always wanted to. Take a walk for no reason at all. Go on that roller coaster once more. Call up your 89 year old grandma on the phone. There are some things that you just have to do that may not make sense in the short term, but in the long term will make all the difference.</p>

<p>Remember: <a href="http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2012/02/03/almost-everyone-on-their-death-bed-regrets-working-too-much/">nobody</a> ever said on their deathbed, 'I wish I had spent more time working'.</p>

          <h1><a href="/watching-from-the-sidelines.html" class="posttitle" rel="bookmark">Watching From The Sidelines</a></h1>
          <p class="date">Posted 19 March 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>It's not rare that I stumble upon a blog post where the founder of a startup talks about their launch, how many users they signed up, and how much they learned from it. Well, I think that you can learn a lot from other people's startups too, without having to take part in them. I think the ability to learn from startups that aren't yours is very useful. Here's how I learn from products and the people behind them, all while just watching from the sidelines.</p>

<p>Whenever a new social networking service emerges I usually sign up and try it out, usually to see what the hype is about and to give it a fair chance. I do this because trying out other  apps and services is a great way to learn how to create your own. It's a great chance to learn how they launched and created hype, why people are using it, how effective their signup process is, and most importantly, what aspects of the service you should or should not use in your next project.</p>

<p>There's a lot you can learn from launches, but if you actually spend some time and use the service, you end up learning a lot more. For as much as the launch exposes about the service and the people behind it, they only undercover a fraction of the methodology behind it.</p>

<p>It's important to ask questions such as why are people using it? What real problems does it solve? If there's other services already doing something like this, what makes it special?</p>

<hr />

<p>Let's use <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> as an example. Foursquare launched four years ago, but students at my high school are just now beginning to use it. Why now? Why are they using it over Facebook's Places feature, where most students already have accounts? Thanks to the notifications I receive whenever a Facebook friend of mine signs up for Foursquare, I have been able to see exactly how the service is spreading throughout my school. First it was one group of friends, then it spread to another. After becoming Foursquare friends with a few of these people, I was interested to see that many of their checkins have photos attached. From what I've seen, they take many more photos than my original Foursquare friends. Why? Facebook already allows you to attach photos to Places checkins. What makes Foursquare more appealing?</p>

<p>How is Foursquare targeting these people? From what I can tell, they're using Facebook and Twitter, services the students are already on. Once they can get a few key people to join, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a> will start doing it's thing, and more and more students will begin to sign up because their friends wanted them to.</p>

<p>Foursquare aimed at early adopters first, then relied on existing social networks and word of mouth to spread to the average consumer.</p>

<hr />

<p>Foursquare is just one example. I challenge you to sit down and consider how other startups launched, and moved from the early adopter stage to the average consumer stage. What techniques did they use? How did they target the early adopters? Most importantly, how can you apply these techniques to your own startup?</p>

<p>Digging below the surface and analyzing products and their launches can be very helpful. There's a lot that you can learn without having to really do anything yourself. What kind of questions will you ponder?</p>

          <h1><a href="/t-shirts.html" class="posttitle" rel="bookmark">T-Shirts</a></h1>
          <p class="date">Posted 12 March 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>I find T-Shirts to be fascinating. Give someone a free t-shirt, and unless the content is unnecessairly absurd they will probably wear it.</p>

<p>Why? My guess is that it's because T-Shirts usually cost a fairly substancial amount of money in stores, but branded T-Shirts such as ones with company logos across the front are usually free.</p>

<p>I've caught myself wearing a T-Shirt before with the logo of a company I don't even care about printed across the front in large bold letters. As far as I know, I've seen other people do it too.</p>

<p>What fascinates me is that T-Shirts seem to be the only product that we will do this too. Imagine a company giving you a bumber sticker. Unless you truly loved or worked for the company, would you put it on your car? What if they gave you a free T-Shirt, what are the chances that you would wear it at least once?</p>
