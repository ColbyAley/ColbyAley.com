##My Jekyll Powered Blog
This is my blog, one that I have personally designed. When building it I found it helpful to look at the source of other Jekyll blogs. That's why I'm publishing mine on Github. I hope it helps you out. If this isn't enough, feel free to email me at colby@aley.me.

###Deployment
I use Rsync to deploy. It makes deploying the site SUPER easy.

###Copyright
All I ask for is that you do not republish the contents of the /_posts directory without my permission. Other than that, have at it.

###Am I an idiot?
Am I doing somehting blatantly wrong? If so, please let me know. My email is above.
